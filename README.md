# Quizzable

Quizzable is a website that allows you to make flashcards and quizzes. It is a work in progress, and is currently in the alpha stage. It is made using Pocketbase and Nextjs and is hosted [here](http://quizzable.trevord.live/).

## Features

Quizzable currently has four main features, which will be implemented soon.

### Leaderboards

Leaderboards are a way to see how you compare to other users. You can see the top 10 users for each category. Leaderboard positions are determined by the number of points you have. Points are earned by taking quizzes and getting a high score, or by completing flashcards quickly.
