# Design Brief

Quizzable is a study tool designed to help users learn faster. It offers over 10 customizable study modes for study decks, allowing users to choose the mode that works best for them. In order to effectively reach its users, Quizzable's design should aim to portray feelings of professionalism, creativity, and accessibility.

### Objectives

- To create a professional and engaging design that reflects Quizzable's goal of helping users learn faster.
- To create a user-friendly and visually interesting design that is easy to navigate.
- To ensure clear calls to action and intuitive study modes.
- To choose a font that is appropriate for the content and easy to read.
- To select a color scheme that reflects Quizzable's brand values and promotes a positive user experience.

### Target Audience

Quizzable's target audience includes students, professionals, and anyone looking to expand their knowledge. The design should be accessible and engaging to users of all ages and backgrounds.

## Design Elements

### Font

The font should be clear and legible, while also being engaging and interesting. Serif fonts such as Times New Roman or Georgia can give a classic and professional look, while sans-serif fonts such as Helvetica or Open Sans can provide a clean and sleek look. Script fonts such as Pacifico or Dancing Script can add a playful touch, and bold fonts such as Impact or Bebas Neue can emphasize important information and create a sense of urgency.

- **Heading 1:** For a bold and attention-grabbing font, a modern display font like "Montserrat Black" or "Abril Fatface" would work well.

- **Heading 2-6:** For the subheadings, transitional serif fonts like "Merriweather” or "Palatino” would be a good choice.

- **Paragraph Text:** A humanist sans serif font like "Open Sans" or "Roboto" would be easy to read and not distract from the content.

- **Navigation Text:** For clear and legible navigation text, a geometric sans serif font like "Avenir" or "Proxima Nova" would work well.

In the case of Quizzable, the font necessary for the layout should be easy to read and not distract from the content. A sans-serif font such as Open Sans or Helvetica would be appropriate for the paragraph text, while a bold font such as Impact or Bebas Neue could be used for important information or calls to action. The font for the navigation should also be clear and easy to read, with a size that is appropriate for the layout.

### Colors

The color scheme should reflect Quizzable's brand values and promote a positive user experience. Colors such as blue or green can promote a sense of productivity and focus, while red or orange can create a sense of urgency and excitement. Shades of gray or black can provide a professional and sleek look, while brighter colors such as yellow or purple can add a sense of creativity and originality.

### Layout

The design should be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear calls to action and intuitive study modes. The layout should be visually interesting and promote a positive user experience.

## Conclusion

The design for Quizzable should aim to create a professional, engaging, and accessible user experience. By selecting appropriate fonts, colors, and layout, Quizzable can effectively reach its target audience of students, professionals, and anyone looking to expand their knowledge.
